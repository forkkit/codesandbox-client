      <TitleDescription>
        CodeSandbox is a company that aims to make it easy for everyone to
        create applications. We want to cut away the hassle of setting up the
        environment, installing the tooling and sharing your project with
        others. We are specifically focused on lowering the barrier to entry of
        web development and want to make creating applications both easier and
        faster.
        <br />
        <br />
        Do you resonate with this goal? Then CodeSandbox is the right place for
        you! At CodeSandbox you have the chance to work on development tooling
        that’s used by more than a million people on a monthly basis. You’ll get
        the chance to be part of the founding team and will have a big impact on
        how the online development tooling will be shaped in the future. We’re
        also an open source company, the majority of our work is in the open and
        the community is a big part of us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team is remote-first, you can work from wherever you’d like. Our
        current team is distributed across The Netherlands, Romania and Germany.
        <br />
        <br />
        We’re looking forward to meeting you!
